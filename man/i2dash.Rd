\title{'i2dash': A package for programmatic creation of interactive, web-based dashboards}
\description{
'i2dash' relies on the widely used R packages 'flexdashboard', 'knitr' and 'rmarkdown'. 'i2dash' introduces a new class from R's S4 object system named \linkS4class{i2dashboard}, which by design provides the main functionality of the package. Besides global properties such as the dashboard title, author and theme, an instance of the \linkS4class{i2dashboard} class also stores individual dashboard pages and the navigation menu, as well as all components that make up the content of individual pages.
